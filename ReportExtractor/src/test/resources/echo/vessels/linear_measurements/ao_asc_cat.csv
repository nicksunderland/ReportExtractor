Summary:

Probably mild mixed mitral valve disease-severely dilated LA.

Aortic stenosis noted which is probably within the mild to moderate range.

At least mild TR-severely dilated RA-TR PG=47mmHg + RAP estimated at 20mmHg therefore PASP by echo is within the 67mmHg range, please correlate clinically. 



Left Ventricle

The left ventricle is normal in size. There appears to be mild concentric LVH measuring approximately 1.3cms with increased thickening of the basal septal wall in keeping with a sigmoid septal bulge. From the images obtained and in the presence of AF overall LV systolic function appears within normal limits. Due to the limitations of this scan it is not possible to fully exclude a basal to mid inferior wall motion abnormality. 



Right Ventricle

The right ventricle is normal size. The RV is difficult to accurately assess however from what can be seen does not appear significantly dilated or significantly impaired in the presence of AF. 



Left Atrium

The left atrium is severely dilated. Due to the limitations of this scan the atrial septum could not be assessed. 



Mitral Valve

The mitral valve appears calcified with reduced mobility and increased forward flows, peak gradient is approximately 16mmHg with a mean gradient of approximately 4mmHg which would suggest mild mitral stenosis. There is mild mitral regurgitation. 



Tricuspid Valve

The tricuspid valve leaflets are thin and pliable. There is no tricuspid stenosis. There is at least mild TR however this is difficult to accurately assess. TR peak gradient is averaged at 47mmHg + JVP for an estimated PASP. 



Aortic Valve

The aortic valve is significantly calcified with reduced mobility-from the images obtained a pseudo-bicuspid valve cannot be excluded with probable fusion of the left and non-coronary cusps. AV forward flows are mildly increased in the presence of mitral stenosis with a peak gradient detected at 15mmHg and a mean gradient detected at 8mmHg, AVA is estimated at between 1.3-1.4cms2 however visual 2-D planimetry estimates the valve area at approximately 1.9cms2-findings are suggestive of at least mild to moderate AS with as much as moderate stenosis overall. 



Pulmonary Valve

The pulmonic valve is not well visualized. There is no pulmonic valvular stenosis. Trace pulmonic valvular regurgitation. 



Great Vessels

The aortic root is normal size. The aortic arch was not well seen on this scan. 



Pericardium / Pleura

There is no pericardial effusion. 



Right Atrium

The right atrium is severely dilated. 



Inferior vena cava

The IVC measures 2.3cms in size with poor respiratory variation which in the presence of a severely dilated RA suggests an estimated RAP in the 20mmHg range-please correlate with clinical findings.

Summary:

Very poor apical images with mostly non-diagnostic images obtained from what can be seen:

Severe aortic stenosis-trace AR.

Moderate mitral stenosis-trace MR. 

From the images obtained the RV appears severely impaired.

LV does not appear significantly dilated-LV systolic function appears within normal limits. 



Left Ventricle

The LV does not appear dilated. Visually there is at least moderate LVH. From the parasternal images only the LV systolic function appears within normal limits-unable to assess from the apical views. 



Right Ventricle

Difficult to accurately assess the RV due to poor apical images however from the parasternal images only the RV appears normal in size with severely impaired systolic function. 



Left Atrium

Visually the LA appears dilated however an accurate measure of the dilatation could not be made on this scan. 



Mitral Valve

The MV appears heavily calcified particularly around the annulus. MV forward flows are increased with a peak gradient of 13-14mmHg and a mean gradient of 5-6mmHg which suggests moderate stenosis. There is trace mitral regurgitation. 



Tricuspid Valve

The tricuspid valve is not well visualized. There is no tricuspid stenosis. CW Doppler signals suggest trace to mild TR. Due to poor quality signals an estimated PASP could not be calculated. 





Aortic Valve

The aortic valve is significantly calcified with reduced mobility. AV forward flows are increased with a peak gradient detected at 81mmHg and a mean gradient detected at 47mmHg, valve area is calculated at approximately 0.59-0.61cms2-findings are in keeping with severe aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation. 



Pulmonary Valve

The pulmonic valve is not well visualized. There is no pulmonic valvular stenosis. Trace pulmonic valvular regurgitation. 



Great Vessels

From what can be seen of the aortic root there does not appear to be any significant dilatation. The aortic arch was not well seen. 



Pericardium / Pleura

There is no pericardial effusion. 



Right Atrium

The right atrium is not well visualized. 



Inferior vena cava

The inferior vena cava is not well visualised.
